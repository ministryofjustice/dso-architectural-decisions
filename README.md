# Digital Studio Operations - Architectural Decisions

This repository is used to record architectural decisions made by the [Digital Studio Operations Team](https://dsdmoj.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/DSTT/overview). The bulk of these decisions will be in aid of modernising the Fix & Go hosting infrastructure, although all projects under the team's remit will have their architectural decisions recorded here.

To understand why we are recording decisions and how we are doing it, please
see [ADR-001](doc/adr/0001-record-architecture-decisions.md).
